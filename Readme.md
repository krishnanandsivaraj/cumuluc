A Simple note
```
    All the technologies that are used in the hackathon are there not because they are new but because it suits our need  
    * We have decided to go with aws because AWS works with our requirements.
    * We have used NodeJS because we wanted our upload codebase to be simple.
    * We have used C# lambdas for concurrency and multi threaded operations.
